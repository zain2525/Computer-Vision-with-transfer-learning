# Food Vision 101‚Ñ¢ üçîüëÅ
## Transfer Learning With TensorFlow (Feature Extraction & Fine-Tuning):

## What we're going to cover
### 1. Using Kaggel Datasets to download and explore data
##### * Split the data to (train, validation and test)
### 2. Creating preprocessing function for our data
##### * Create function to walk through an image classification directory
### 3. Batching & preparing datasets for modelling (making our datasets run fast)
### 4. Creating modelling callbacks
### 5. Setting up mixed precision training
### 6. Building a feature extraction model
### 7. Fine-tuning the feature extraction model
### 8. Saving and loading our model
### 9. Evaluating the performance of the big model across all different classes
### 10. Making predictions with our trained model
### 11. Evaluating our models predictions
### 12. Visualizing predictions on test images
### 13. Finding the most wrong predictions
### 14. Test out the model on custom images of food
